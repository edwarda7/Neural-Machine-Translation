When I was a kid , I thought <unk> was the best country in the world , and I often sang , &quot; We don &apos;t have to envy . &quot;
I was very proud of my country .
In school , we spent a lot of time studying the life of the President <unk> <unk> , but not much more about the outside world , except the United States and Japan is our enemy .
Although I was wondering I didn &apos;t know the outside world , but I still thought I &apos;d live my life in <unk> , until everything suddenly changed .
When I was seven , I saw the police <unk> for the first time in my life , but I still think my life is totally normal .
My family is not poor , and I &apos;m not hungry .
But one day by 1995 , my mother brought home a letter from a sister who was working with her mother .
And in that word , when you read these lines , all five of these families , their five families were not on this earth anymore , because their family had nothing to eat for two weeks .
It &apos;s all on the floor , and our bodies are weak to feel like dying is coming close .
I was shocked .
Because it was the first time I knew that my <unk> was suffering .
Not long after , when I went through a station , I saw a horror scenario that I never could have forgotten .
On the garage is the <unk> of a male lady holding a <unk> <unk> , and the baby is just staring at her face .
But no one helped them , because it &apos;s all being concerned for themselves and family .
In the middle of 90s , North Korea did a severe famine famine .
It makes more than a million Koreans died in hunger , and many people just survived the grass , <unk> and <unk> .
The current <unk> is more often , so everything around me is dark when the night came to the surface , except from the light from the China , just how my home was a river .
I always wonder why they have electricity , we wouldn &apos;t .
This is a photograph from the North South Korea <unk> during the night in relation to the surrounding world .
This is the <unk> River <unk> , which is the natural border between North Korea and China .
It might be a narrow <unk> that some of the South South South Koreans crossed China .
But many of them died .
And I saw exactly the way that they floating on the river .
I can &apos;t tell you how far I &apos;ve escaped from North Korea , and I can tell you that in the &apos; 80s of the misery of starvation , I &apos;m sent to China to live with a very far person .
At the time , I just thought I &apos;d be going to have to have a short family .
I would never imagine that I would have had to go back and ask them 14 years from now .
In China , her life is getting taken from my family as a very difficult way .
I had no idea what happened to a refugee person from North Korea , which would be , but I soon realized that it wasn &apos;t very hard , but it was incredibly dangerous , because the refugees from North Korea were <unk> .
I was always living in a very <unk> fear that my identity would be detected , and I was going to be returned to the old life in North Korea .
One day , that nightmare was true , and I was seeing in Chinese police and brought to the police department to deal with .
Someone who reported that I was North Koreans , so they tested my Chinese ability and ask me a lot of questions .
I was so scared , and I felt like my heart was about to explode .
Because if they saw anything that doesn &apos;t happen , I would be sent to jail and then got back to water .
I think my life is the end , but I &apos;m trying to manipulate my emotions and answer their questions .
After you &apos;re done , one of the two cops said to the other , this is a false point .
It &apos;s not North Korea . &quot;
And they released me out . It was a miracle .
There were some North Koreans in China that went to the foreign embassy for <unk> , but many of them were caught by the Chinese police and was returned to the water .
These girls were so fortunate .
Because even though we were arrested , but eventually we were <unk> by the <unk> of international communities .
But these Koreans did not have been so fortunate .
Every year , there were countless North Koreans who were caught in China and got paid in water , where they were tortured , or <unk> or mutilated .
While I was lucky enough , my few few of my brain wasn &apos;t going to be so .
North Koreans have to cover his identity and struggle to be a consequence .
Even when learning Chinese and found a job , their life could be <unk> entirely in one moment .
That &apos;s why 10 years after the 10 years <unk> identity , I decided to take myself to South Korea , to start a new life again .
The stability of living is a lot tougher than I imagined .
Because in Korea , English is very important , so I started learning English , my third language .
I also realized that a very large gap between North and North Korea .
We were all the Koreans , but it was very different from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
I went through a terrible crisis .
I &apos;m South Koreans or North Korea ?
Where am I coming from ? And who am I ?
Suddenly , I had no country to be proud of the Organization .
Even though I like to go in Korean , it &apos;s not easy to do , but I &apos;ve set a plan .
And we started to learn to prepare for the next semester .
But as soon as I &apos;ve just been familiar with my life , I was reporting incredible news .
North Korea did the money that I sent back to my family , and , to punish them , they &apos;ll get my family to move in a <unk> way in rural .
And so they could quickly escape , I started planning my family to escape .
North Koreans has to cross the distance that seems to be impossible to come with freedom .
Because it &apos;s not possible to cross the border from North North Korea , almost as impossible , so I have to fly to China and go backwards and go back to North Korea .
Because my family didn &apos;t know Chinese , so I had to go and spend people by 2,000 miles in China and then to East Asia .
The journey by a bus lasted about a week , and it was a couple times the time we were almost arrested .
Once , our car was blocked and was discovered by a Chinese officer .
He &apos;s recording everybody &apos;s letter and starts investigating .
Because my family didn &apos;t understand the Chinese , so I thought they &apos;d be arrested .
When the Chinese police came near them , I immediately got up and told him that these are the <unk> I &apos;ve been working with .
He looks at me full of doubt , but fortunately he believed me .
And we kept going on to the <unk> border , and I had to use almost the entire amount of money that I had to pay for the <unk> guard .
However , after we passed the border , my family got caught in jail for <unk> .
After I applied my fine and I gave bribes , my family was released in a month , and then caught again in the capital of <unk> .
It was the most glorious time in my life .
I was enough to get my family to freedom , and I was nearly being successful , but they were caught while we were only the <unk> <unk> .
I went back to the middle of the public department and the police , desperate to find a way to get my family out of it , but I was not enough money to pay bribes or pay to pay any more .
I was absolutely desperate .
At that time , a man asked me , &quot; What &apos;s the story ? &quot;
I was incredibly surprised when someone was totally foreign from the idea of how I was .
Using my own English language and a dictionary , I told him the complete picture of my family , and not a little bit of his project , and that man went to the <unk> -- and he pays all the money that had lost
I thank him to be with my heart , and I said , &quot; Why do you help me ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t help her , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;m helping North Korea . &quot;
I realized that it was a huge , significant moment in my life .
<unk> from strangers became a new vision of hope for me and also the North Koreans when we were really necessary with it , and he showed me the kindness of the strangers and the community of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the
Finally , after a long journey and my family was united in Korea , but came to the freedom that was only half of the struggle .
Many of North Koreans are being divided with their families , and when they get to another country , they have to start with very little or less or less <unk> .
So we can take help from international communities for education , education education , educating , and many other areas .
We can also act as the bridge between the people in North Korea with the outside world , because there are many of us that are in contact with other families in the water , and we share the <unk> to change North Korea from the inside .
I was incredibly fortunate to get a lot of help and inspiring throughout my entire life , so I wanted to be able to share the world to bring my country a chance to develop with the support of international support .
I believe that you will see more and more North Korea doing all the places in the world , including on the TED stage .
Thank you .
I &apos;m just one request today .
Don &apos;t tell me that I was normal .
Now I want to introduce you to my brother .
<unk> 22 years old , high and very beautiful .
I &apos;m not saying , but I &apos;m saying it &apos;s a joy in the way even some most courageous best superheroes can &apos;t do .
<unk> knows what love love is .
He shares it a <unk> way of <unk> .
He didn &apos;t sit in . He didn &apos;t differentiate the color .
I &apos;m not interested in the religious difference , and let &apos;s understand that she &apos;s never lying .
When I sing songs from our childhood , trying to remember words that I couldn &apos;t be , I could not be able to remember that I was not able to , and what was great about .
Samuel was 16 . She was high . He was very handsome .
I have a perfectly good working memory .
But it &apos;s also selection .
I don &apos;t remember if I had my chocolate <unk> , but I remember my <unk> <unk> song , talks between my iPod , I was four years old , <unk> &apos;s birthday on the <unk> , and the birthday of <unk> <unk> .
And that sounds great , right ?
But most people disagree .
And in fact , because of my mind , I don &apos;t fit to the normal , normal social <unk> , they are often given and understood .
But what makes my heart more <unk> and more powerful is that , although this is true , even though they &apos;re not considered normal , that would only mean that they are extraordinary and extraordinary people .
For you not so much with the term &quot; autism , &quot; it &apos;s a brain disorder that influences the ability to communicate social communications , learning and sometimes as the physical memories .
The symptom of disease in each individual , that &apos;s why <unk> is so different .
And around the world , 20 minutes more than a diagnosis of autism has autism , and even though it &apos;s one of the developmental disorders that grow at the fastest speed in the world , we don &apos;t know the reason or treatment .
And I can &apos;t remember the first time I had access to autism , but I can &apos;t remember one day without it .
I was three years old when my brother was born and I was incredibly excited that there was another new person in my life .
And after a few months , I realized that I was different .
He &apos;s yelling .
I didn &apos;t want to play as if they were , and in fact , I didn &apos;t seem to be interested in anything or anything else .
<unk> and <unk> in our own world , with our own rules , and I have a lot of joy in the smallest things , like <unk> cars around the room and stare at the washing machine , and you &apos;re looking at the washing and eating
When I grew up , I became more different , and the difference became clearer .
But beyond the anger and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> is something that is really unique : pure instinct and naive , a boy who looks at a life without prejudice , a human being never lied .
<unk> .
Well , I can &apos;t deny that there were some tough moments in my family , moments I wish you just like to do it .
But I take my memories back to the things that I taught me about personality , the way the communication and the love , and I realize that these are things that I will not be able to trade for .
It &apos;s a normal <unk> that is given us and what we &apos;re not doing is what we &apos;re doing .
It just means there &apos;s a different type of <unk> .
And if I can only convey one thing for <unk> and for Sam and for you , it &apos;s not that you don &apos;t force to be normal .
You can get extraordinary .
Because there &apos;s a <unk> or not , the difference between us -- We have a gift ! We have a gift , and honestly , after average , the greatest sacrifice is the greatest potential .
The opportunity for the greater , progress and for the change is shut down when we try to become like another .
Please -- don &apos;t say I &apos;m okay .
Thank you .
You &apos;ll all agree with me a beautiful way of being a beautiful road .
It &apos;s built from plastic plastic , and asphalt is the kind of vehicles that run on it , but not always , especially not on these days when it &apos;s <unk> .
Then you can get water on the road <unk> .
And especially if you bike , and you pass through these cars , real <unk> .
And also , plastics are also making a lot of noise .
It &apos;s a material material , if we &apos;re going to make the streets of the Dutch , is very close to the cities , we want a quiet road .
The solution to this is to make sugar from asphalt asphalt .
<unk> sugars is the material we &apos;re currently using to build almost the most Western countries in the Netherlands , and it &apos;s got <unk> and water that &apos;s just <unk> so that all the rain will come out of the ground , and you get a vehicle that &apos;s not
And it &apos;s also <unk> .
Because it &apos;s hollow , all noise will disappear , so that the road is very quiet .
Of course there &apos;s still a lot of <unk> , and the <unk> of this sugar is <unk> , the <unk> can happen .
What &apos;s the crack ? You see on this path that &apos;s a <unk> layer .
So first you get a rock , and then more , and more and more , and more , and then -- oh , I won &apos;t .
But they can <unk> your car . So you &apos;re not happy with that .
And after all , this <unk> state will damage more and more .
Sometimes they make chicken balls .
Yeah . He &apos;s ready .
<unk> chickens , of course , could be a problem , but we have solutions .
It &apos;s actually like you see here that this material is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , as I said , you only have a little sticky sticky tape between the stones .
So , under the impact of the weather , the radiation radiation , the <unk> of this plastic , this plastic <unk> , this plastic <unk> , this <unk> <unk> , is <unk> , and then , if it &apos;s going to , it &apos;s going to have these <unk> <unk> <unk> out of the rest of the future .
And then if driving the car over there , you would destroy these <unk> blocks -- as we just saw here .
To solve this problem , we made <unk> materials .
If we made this <unk> , we can find solutions .
What we can do is we can use the <unk> <unk> <unk> steel , and we cut out the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we mix these little pieces of pieces with plastic <unk> .
So we have a very small <unk> of steel .
Then you need a machine , you see here , the machine you see here , the machine for cooking -- a sensor that comes from .
<unk> can be <unk> , especially steel .
So what you do is you heat up steel , you get plastic flowing , and plastic gets flowing into these little cracks , and the stones would be <unk> back into the back of the face .
I use a <unk> <unk> , because I can &apos;t get a <unk> from the <unk> to the stage .
<unk> also have the same operating system .
I &apos;ve been able to prototype it , I &apos;m going to take it out to test how it is .
This is the prototype that &apos;s taken out .
I said we invented a factory like this in the <unk> to heat the pieces of samples .
In the lab we &apos;ve tried through many samples , and then governments , they &apos;ve actually seen the <unk> and they say , &quot; Well , that &apos;s interesting . We &apos;ve got to try to see what . &quot;
Then they sent us a new route , 400 meters of <unk> , where we had to build a new <unk> track line .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done here . You see the way we &apos;ve been doing this , and then of course this path will survive for years and years that no <unk> . That &apos;s what we &apos;re learning from the experimental .
We &apos;ve taken samples from this path and we tried them in the lab .
So we get the model , put it on a lot of payload , put it in a responsive machine , <unk> them back and tried them again .
We can do it again so many times .
And indeed , the conclusion that came out of this research is that if we were to protect the road four years -- this is a huge size of size we built it to <unk> -- if we were four years old , we could save the <unk>
Well , to <unk> , I can tell you we &apos;ve made a material using steel , added steel , using the heat , to really increase the lifespan of the road , eight years old , which is actually making a lot of money .
Now you &apos;re wondering whether it &apos;s effective or not .
We &apos;re here in the prototype . It &apos;s pretty warm .
It &apos;s supposed to be cool before , and I showed you the effectiveness of <unk> .
But let me try and see .
Watch it . Well , it &apos;s sticky .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here today to talk about a question that the answer is also wrong .
The topic is the secret of the family violence , and the question I ask is the question that people ask : Why is she staying ?
Why should the women have been beaten with them ?
I &apos;m not a psychiatrist , not a social worker or a professional expert .
I &apos;m just a woman who wants to share their story .
And then I was 22 years old , and I graduated from Harvard College .
I moved to New York City when I first did my first job and editor for <unk> magazine .
For the first time I had my apartment , my own American <unk> card , and I had a big secret .
So the secret is that this gun was loaded on a bullet <unk> , and it was straight in my head because the man I thought was the partner , this time over .
The man who was in love with everybody <unk> in the head and death killed me knew how many times I was missing .
I came here to tell you about the crazy love , a <unk> trap that was <unk> in love with a million women and even a population of <unk> .
This may be your story .
I &apos;m not like a domestic <unk> .
I have the English <unk> from Harvard School , and I &apos;ve been on the marketing <unk> business from the <unk> business .
I was so inspired to work for companies in the 500 of America like Johnson and Johnson , Leo and Leo and the Washington Times .
I married the second husband that was almost 20 years and had children together .
My dog is the <unk> , and I &apos;m driving the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So what I want to tell you is that domestic violence happens to everyone , every religion , every education and education .
It happens everywhere .
And the second thing I want to say is that people think that domestic violence happens to women , which is the problem of women .
It &apos;s not true .
<unk> percent of the <unk> are men , and domestic violence happens in the relationships of <unk> , <unk> , long-term , long-term relationships , in a long family , where we want to be willing or expect to find a problem .
I told myself , I was the other person left in life with the man who beat me , but I was , I was a typical <unk> victim .
I was 22 years old , living in the United States , and the woman was 16 to 24 to 24 times as much as the victims of domestic violence compared to women in other ages , and over 500 women and women in the U.S.
I was also a typical victim because I had no idea of what domestic violence had , the warning signals or patterns .
I met <unk> for a single night , rain and cold .
He sat next to me in the New York City <unk> , and he started talking to me .
He told me two things .
One is he , like me , just as well as the <unk> College <unk> , and that he works in a very impressive bank in the Wall Street .
But the thing that was most dramatic to me in the first meeting was he was a playful and he was kind of a farmer .
He has this big <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and he looks like a <unk> and he looks very sweet .
One of the most smartest things that <unk> did , since the beginning of beginning , was to create a hallucination that I was a huge relationship .
He did this for the first time by the beginning of religion .
We started dating , and he loved me in every aspect that I was very clever , that I had a <unk> I had to do a lot of a <unk> and a lot of my work .
He wanted to know about everything about my family and my childhood , my dreams and dreams .
My trust , as a writer and a woman in a way that no one has ever had .
And he also creates the magic of the incredible <unk> of trust between us by looking at his secrets , that he &apos;s as a kid who &apos;s four years old , and he &apos;s been <unk> on his <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
That explains why it &apos;s at <unk> <unk> and the job in Wall Street and his brilliant future matter how big he means .
If you tell me that the smart man , his <unk> , <unk> , my <unk> <unk> me a day of <unk> when I was <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any relationship had a <unk> , is temptation and seduction victims .
I didn &apos;t know the second stage was isolated .
Now , <unk> didn &apos;t go home for a day and announced &quot; Hey , I know , all this sort of stupid <unk> and <unk> , but I need to move on the next stage where my neighbors can hear her <unk> . &quot;
So , <unk> came home on a Friday night , and he told me he quit his day to work with his dream , and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to spend my job , because I &apos;m feeling so safe and loved him , and he &apos;s
Now , the last thing I want to do is leave New York City and my dream , but I thought you had to sacrifice your partner , so I quit and I quit my life , and I went down and I went off .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve gotten a crazy love , that I &apos;m walking into the psychological psychology , and it &apos;s all about being laid out .
The next step in this violent scenario is to put in the threat and see how she works .
From here , the guns come in .
When we moved to New England -- you know , where <unk> relies on how safe it is .
He holds one of the <unk> of our car .
A half a half trouble our bedroom is , he always has a <unk> in the air .
And he said that he needs these guns because the damage he had experienced in the past as a child .
He needs them to be able to feel secure .
But these guns actually are a message for me , and although he hasn &apos;t launched my arms , but my life in danger is at risk every single day .
<unk> attacked me five days ago from our wedding .
It was at seven o &apos;clock in the morning when I was wearing my <unk> .
I was <unk> on the roof , trying to write the article that I felt , and I felt frustrated , <unk> my anger , like my <unk> , which I was <unk> to take my arms and <unk> my neck , and he started to <unk> me .
Five days later , these 10 <unk> on my neck were up , and I wore my mother &apos;s wedding dress , and I got married with him .
And despite that , I &apos;m still sure we &apos;ll live happily because I love him and he also love me too much .
And he was <unk> .
He was really tough for the wedding and the setting to me .
It &apos;s a <unk> , and he &apos;s never going to hurt me anymore .
It took two times more time in the moon .
For the first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost , and he hit one side of my head that was very strong to begin with me to <unk> on the window of the car .
A few days later , when I was driving home home after the moon , he was tired of the car , and he threw his bag of <unk> <unk> on my face .
<unk> hit me one and two times a week after two months and half of the year since marriage .
I was wrong to think that I was the only case and I was alone in this .
One third American women experience domestic violence or <unk> samples in some stages of their life and reported the CDC Court to see 15 million children were abused every year , 15 million .
So I was in a really good business .
Well , back to my question : Why am I here ?
The answer is very easy .
I don &apos;t know him being <unk> me .
He even pointed in my head , pushed me down to the floor , threatens my <unk> , pulled out the <unk> , and I was in my <unk> , and I was wearing my <unk> , I was wearing my career , and I was wearing a <unk>
Instead , I &apos;m a strong woman in love with a man with a problem , and I &apos;m the only person on earth who can help <unk> to his ugly .
The other question that people ask , why did she abandon ?
Why didn &apos;t I walk ? I could leave any time .
For me , it was the most painful question , because we , the victim who knew something you don &apos;t know : it was a terrible danger to leave a <unk> .
Because the last step in the <unk> play was killing her .
Over 70 percent of the crime crime <unk> that happened after the victim had over the relationship , after she moved away , because then the violence had nothing left .
But the other consequence was that , in fact , after the <unk> , even after the <unk> , <unk> from the financial sources ; the dynamics of the family system to be terrified of the <unk> of the men .
And we have to go on and ask , why wouldn &apos;t she abandon ?
I was able to leave , because my last crude rock had failed away from my left .
I realized that the man I love love would kill me if I drop him .
So I broke silence .
I told people the <unk> , the neighbors , my friends and family , who are totally foreign , and I stand here today because you &apos;re helping me .
We have the stereotypes of the <unk> of victims as the terrifying ones , the women who destroy themselves , the best things that are hurt .
The question , &quot; Why are you in ? &quot;
The reason that some of the people , &quot; This is her fault when the victim had chosen to love men with the idea of destroying us .
But since I published &quot; Love Love &quot; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of stories from men and women who have left , who learned a terrible life lesson , but what has happened , and who have been able to create a life that &apos;s not violence , and
Because the truth I &apos;m a typical of violence has been over me is the <unk> survivors of the family violence .
I married with a nice man and kindness , and we have three children .
I have the <unk> , I have the <unk> .
What I never had is that I had half , ever a <unk> in my head because someone said he fell in love .
Right now , you might be thinking , &quot; Well , this is wonderful , &quot; or , &quot; Oh , this is amazing , &quot; oh , what you &apos;re so stupid about , &quot; but all this time , I &apos;ve really talked about you .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re probably listening to me that this is the people who are hearing or <unk> when you &apos;re a child or <unk> .
<unk> can affect your daughter , your girlfriend , your best friend right now .
I can end my crazy love of my crazy love by breaking away .
I &apos;m exploding up with my silences today .
This is how I help other victims , and this is my final request .
Let &apos;s tell you about what you &apos;re listening to .
<unk> is a scary threat .
You &apos;re driven to end the force of simple families by putting in a flash of light .
We have victims that need to be everybody .
We need to be friends to understand the secrets of domestic violence .
<unk> the <unk> of the day by talking about it with your children , your colleagues , friends and family .
<unk> their lives like happiness , <unk> with the open future .
<unk> the early signals of violence and <unk> of conscience , <unk> it down , just for the security victim .
Together we can make our bed our own table and our family , and our own <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
<unk> <unk> is one of the most important <unk> of <unk> .
When you see a <unk> <unk> , the first thing that happens in your mind is that these are <unk> , ugly , <unk> , <unk> , and only aimed to your flesh , and connect to politicians .
I want to change that perception . I want to change the feelings you &apos;re for these birds , because they need to be in our own compassion . They really need to .
I &apos;ll tell you why .
First of all , why are they so dramatic ?
When Charles Darwin crossed the Pacific Ocean from the <unk> train , he saw the Turkish <unk> , he said , &quot; These birds are so disgusting with the <unk> <unk> that was created to celebrate <unk> in <unk> .
You couldn &apos;t get worse from the <unk> , and that &apos;s the words Charles Darwin .
You know , he changed his mind when he comes back , let me tell you why .
They &apos;ve been connected to <unk> being <unk> by <unk> , <unk> , stupid characters .
But more recently , if you were watching news in Kenya -- these are the features that were <unk> to the <unk> forces , but I wanted to resist that .
I want to resist because you know why ?
Because the air doesn &apos;t keep the environment clean .
The police stopped not to stop the spread of disease .
They &apos;re almost not as likely to <unk> a stack of husbands .
They were extinct .
And , what I like most is , the <unk> <unk> .
There are two types of <unk> on the planet .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> found mainly in the United States , like the <unk> and the <unk> , and then the World Bank , where there are 16 species of species . Of these 16 species , there are 11 species of extinction .
So , why is it important ? First of all , they provide basic ecological services . They cleaned up .
They &apos;re actually natural <unk> .
They cleaned up dead <unk> .
They help kill bacteria . They help absorb the coal that it &apos;s been spread to , and causes huge losses for livestock livestock and causes disease for other animals .
The closest studies showed in the areas that don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> , it takes a <unk> amount of time to biodegrade , and the huge implications from this is the spread of disease .
<unk> has also had a great history of their importance .
They were linking with ancient Egyptians .
<unk> is the symbol of the guard and the mother , and the <unk> , the <unk> , they <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of Egypt .
In the Hindu mythology , <unk> was a <unk> god , he took his life to save the <unk> from 10 <unk> .
In the <unk> culture , they made the very important <unk> , and in places like <unk> , there was no place to honor people , or without wood to burn them , so the <unk> provided a natural natural control system .
So what is the <unk> ?
We have the <unk> <unk> in Kenya where there are six species endangered with endangered risk .
The reason for this is that they &apos;re being poison , they &apos;re poison because there are conflicts between the wild world . These community communities are using this poison to order to be in predators .
In South Asia , countries like India and Pakistan , four <unk> , are listed in the list of extreme <unk> that means they &apos;re less than 10 or 15 years of <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
This medicine has been banned in the clinical interest in India , and they &apos;ve demonstrated that they &apos;ve been <unk> .
Because there &apos;s no <unk> that should be <unk> about the number of dogs in the site of <unk> , when you have wild dogs , you have a huge <unk> bomb in the <unk> . Five of the HIV-infected have been much <unk> in India .
Kenya will have a largest wind copper field in Africa with the engine that will be installed in Lake <unk> .
I don &apos;t against the wind , but we need to work with government , because the wind drive these birds . They cut it .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
In West Africa has a <unk> trade trade for the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
So what did we do ? We &apos;re doing this research on these birds . We &apos;re getting a signal on them .
We &apos;re trying to determine their basic ecology , and track them .
We can see them moving into a different variety of countries , so if you focus on the issues on scale scale , this is not going to help you .
We need to collaborate with government on the level of the region .
We &apos;re collaborating with local communities .
We &apos;re telling them about the fact that the <unk> are essential to appreciating these fantastic creatures and the benefits that they bring back .
How do you help ? You could be an active , create voice . You can write your own government and tell them that we need to be serious at the <unk> species .
When you walk out of this room , you get information about <unk> , but let &apos;s tell your family , your children , your neighbor .
They &apos;re very graceful . Charles Darwin said , he changed the idea because he saw it as a <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t need to be <unk> .
Kenya , this world , will be much poorer if there are no such amazing animals .
Thank you very much .
When I was 11 , I remember a morning I woke up listening to my apartment <unk> .
My father was listening to the BBC on the gray radio radio .
He <unk> a big smile , which is very unusual because the news usually makes him feel more <unk> .
He went up : &quot; The Taliban go away ! &quot;
I didn &apos;t know it yet , but I could see my father was very , very happy .
&quot; Now you can actually go to school . &quot; He said .
One morning I couldn &apos;t forget .
It &apos;s a real school .
You know , the Taliban would get in Afghanistan since I was six and stopped from girls to go to school .
In five years , I was dressed to as a boy to walk with my sister to a secret school because my sister was forbidden from my house .
That &apos;s the only way we can go to school .
Every day , we &apos;re walking differently so that we don &apos;t get any doubt about our destination .
We &apos;ve been out to <unk> in the <unk> &apos; <unk> , and people would think we were just shopping .
That one in a house , over 100 of us were <unk> in a small small living room .
It &apos;s pretty warm in winter , but the summer is hot .
We all know that we &apos;re taking our lives and our own lives , our parents and our parents .
There were a few times , a suddenly closed school around a week because of the Pakistani Taliban .
We always ask them what we know about us .
Can we have a surveillance ?
Do they know where we were in ?
We were scared , but we wanted to go to school .
I was fortunate enough to raise in a family that was very respectful and a girl is valuable .
My grandfather was a very serious person .
One man was completely removed from a long <unk> in Afghanistan , and he was <unk> to his daughter , and so he was <unk> .
But my mother has a teacher .
She &apos;s here .
She retired two years ago to use our home to open girls and women in their neighbors .
And this is my father who was the first person in his family .
No doubt that his children will be educated , including his daughter , against the Taliban , and despite danger .
For him , the kids aren &apos;t learning as much greater risk .
In the Taliban , I remember that there were moments when I was angry about our lives and were always terrified and I couldn &apos;t see the future .
I wanted to quit my school , but my father , he would say , &quot; Listen , this is a girl , you can lose everything you have on this life .
The Money of your child may be taken away . You can be forced to leave from the house during the war during the war .
But one thing will forever exist with me is this , and if we are forced to sell blood to pay our <unk> , we will .
So do you want to continue again ?
I &apos;m 22 years old .
I was raised in a country that was being consumed by the 1990s .
Less than six percent of the women I was in high school high school , and if my family didn &apos;t talk to my school , I became one of them .
But , I &apos;m proud here to be a graduate student at NYU <unk> <unk> .
When I went back to Afghanistan , my grandfather , who was <unk> , was left by his family because he was dare to be a kid who was to say to me .
He didn &apos;t show me on my college <unk> , but I was the first woman , and I was the first woman who could carry him on the streets of Kabul .
My family believed me .
I wanted to get a big wish , but my family wanted to wish to me even larger .
So I &apos;m a global Ambassador for <unk> , which is the global campaigning for women .
So I made <unk> , and the first school and was unique for girls in Afghanistan , a country that was still dangerous to girls to school .
I was so excited to see my students to my school , with my ambition to embrace this opportunity .
And I saw my parents and their father , their father , <unk> , even while I &apos;m in <unk> .
Ahmed . It &apos;s not his true name , and I can &apos;t show him , but Ahmed is a father of my student .
Less than a month , he and his daughter was on their way to <unk> from their village , and they were literally killed by a bomb bomb in a few minutes .
When he goes home , the <unk> , the voice , he said he would carry to take his daughter to school , and they &apos;ll try it again .
He said , &quot; If you want to be killed , I &apos;ll kill my daughter for the rest of my daughter &apos;s <unk> and the opposite of the people . &quot;
I &apos;m now now now realizing about Afghanistan , and this is what often often ignored in the West , which is behind most of us to be a <unk> value , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing as a successful family .
This is not the <unk> mother in our success .
In fact , they were the first to be the <unk> of their daughter , but in the context of society , we need to be in the support of men .
In the Taliban , girls who went to school and hundreds of people remember , that &apos;s illegal .
But today , over the three million women in Afghanistan in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks very differently from the United States .
I found that Americans see vulnerability , fragile in changes .
I fear that all those changes would not last after the U.S. military took away .
But when I went back to Afghanistan , when I saw my students and their parents support them , encouraged them , I saw a promise of promise and change that will last long time .
For me , Afghanistan is a country of hope , the capacity of <unk> , and every day the <unk> <unk> reminds me of that .
Like I , they have a big wish .
Thank you .
Hi . This is my cell phone .
A cell phone can change your life , and a phone gives you freedom .
With a cell phone , you can record the action of nuclear rights action .
With a cell phone , you can post a message on <unk> and start to participate a protest against Egypt in Egypt .
And also with a phone , you can write it up to the <unk> and get famous .
All of that can be just with your cell phone .
I &apos;m a kid of 1984 , and I live in Berlin Berlin .
Let &apos;s take back to that moment in the city .
You can see here how thousands of people stand up and protesters for change .
That was the fall of 1989 , and imagine the people who stood up and performed with that change , there was a cell phone in your pocket .
Who in the room with mobile phones ?
Just put it up .
Take your phone up , put your phone up on your phone !
So put up a little bit high . It &apos;s an Android , <unk> , wow .
Many . Today , most of us have a mobile phone .
But today I &apos;m going to talk about myself and my phone , and how it has changed my life .
I &apos;ll talk about that .
There are <unk> blocks .
The <unk> information .
But why is that information here ?
The reason is the summer of 2006 , the European Committee suggested a official official .
It &apos;s called the data archive .
This chart is just about every Western <unk> company , every single American service provider across European Europe , and it has to store vast amounts of information about the users .
Who who is calling for anyone ? Who sent somebody who emailed someone ?
Who sent the mobile message ?
And if you use mobile phone , this is where the problem is .
All of this information stored at least six months , until two years , because the web is already using or provider service .
And all across Europe , people were up and said , &quot; We don &apos;t want to . &quot;
They said , we don &apos;t want this personal information storage .
We wanted to get autonomy in the digital age , and we don &apos;t want to be that the telecommunications company and the Internet provider store all of our information .
They &apos;re lawyers , journalists and fathers , all saying , &quot; We don &apos;t want to . &quot;
And you can see here , like 10,000 people in the streets on the streets of Berlin and <unk> the <unk> &quot; Freedom , &quot; <unk> .
And some people even said , it &apos;s like <unk> 2.0 .
<unk> is the <unk> force of <unk> in Eastern Germany .
I &apos;ve wondered , actually , does it work ?
Are they able to record all our information ?
Every time we use our cell phones ?
So I asked my <unk> to use , <unk> <unk> , provider the greatest telecom provider of the time at that time , and I asked them to , please , send me all my information that they &apos;ve stored .
I asked them to send me one , and I kept asking , but what I get was just one <unk> answer . <unk> blah blah .
But then I said , I wanted to get this information , because they are saving my life .
And I decided to send my court court to court , because I wanted to get this information .
But <unk> <unk> said , no , we &apos;re not going to give you this information .
And finally , I had a deal with them .
I will <unk> the lawsuit , and they provide me the information that I asked .
Because at that time , the federal constitution court court has been saying that the European Union market is not necessarily helpful in the national constitution system .
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD inside .
And on a CD , what I &apos;ve got to do is read on it .
<unk> blocks to information .
The first thing I looked at , and I said , okay , it &apos;s a big data file .
But then I realized , this is all my life .
This is my six months of life , which is recorded all over the <unk> of this data .
And I thought , I thought , what should I do with this ?
Because I can see where I went to that , where I sleep every night , what I did .
But then I said , I wanted to open this information out .
I want it to be known by the public .
Because I want to show you what the data <unk> really is .
So for <unk> Online and <unk> Day City , I do the same thing .
These are live images of life for six months being recorded .
You can zoom out loud or you can <unk> it , you can either reverse back or faster .
You can see each step of that .
You can even know how I went to <unk> in the train to <unk> , and the frequency of the frequency I call the communication communication between those two places .
It can all be with this information .
I had a bit of fear .
But that information is not just about me .
It &apos;s information about all of us .
First , it was just like this , I called my wife and she &apos;s calling me , we spoke to each other a couple of times .
And then some of you call me , they call each other .
And then , one time you call you , and you call you , and you get this huge network network .
But you can see how we communicate together , they call each other , when they go to sleep .
You can see all that .
You can see the most important parts , like leaders in a team .
If you get access to this information , you can see the activity of the community , the society .
If you have access to this information , you can control the entire society .
This is a design of the countries such as China or Iran .
This is a drawing of how to investigate the whole society , because you know who talk to anybody who &apos;s sent the emails , all of that can be if you have access to this information .
And these information stored for at least six months in Europe , until two years .
As I said to start , imagine if all these people on the streets of Berlin fall in 1989 had a mobile phone in my pocket .
And maybe <unk> would know who was involved in this protest , and if <unk> knows who was the leader behind it , it would never be possible .
The fall of the Berlin wall may not exist .
And if that , perhaps the collapse of the Iron nets in the Cold War wouldn &apos;t exist .
Because today , functional agencies and companies want to capture the information they have of us as more and more and more online and <unk> .
They want to be able to track our lives , and therefore they want to capture these information at all times .
<unk> and living in the digital age is not conflict .
What you should do is struggle for your autonomy today .
And you have to fight the rest of it every day .
Then , when you go home , tell our friends that privacy is a 21st-century value , and that is not obsolete .
When you go home , tell only your representatives , by companies and the organ agency can capture the specific information , even though they don &apos;t have to do that .
And if you don &apos;t trust me , ask the web to provide the information they &apos;ve already stored about .
So , in the future , whenever you use your phone , let &apos;s remind you that you have to fight for personal autonomy in this digital age .
Thank you .
Photography was my passion since I was growing up with a camera , but I &apos;d like to share with you the 15 pictures I appreciate most , and I didn &apos;t get one of those .
There is no art , no <unk> , no <unk> , not even interested in the light .
In fact , most of them were taken by the passengers who happened to go past the past travel .
The story begins when I went to New York City to participate in a speech and wife I took a picture of my first birthday &apos;s birthday . We &apos;re in the East Street corner .
We happened to go back to New York for a year after that , so we decided to take a picture .
You can see where the story is going .
When I was going to be born to my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; Why don &apos;t you take <unk> to New York making a <unk> trip and daughter , and then keep on the same question ? &quot;
We started asking visitors through the path .
You know , the camera on your camera for a stranger of a totally alien stranger worldwide worldwide .
No one &apos;s being rejected , and fortunately , no one leaves with our camera .
We didn &apos;t know how much the journey would change our lives .
It became sacred for us .
This was taken a couple weeks after 9 / 11 , and I tried to explain what happened that day in the ways that a five-year-old could understand .
These pictures are not just representing a moment , or a trip .
They &apos;re the way we &apos;re going to spend time for a week of October , thinking about our time and how we change every year , not only physically , but in any ways .
Because we took the same image , but our views changed , my daughter achieved new marks , and I was seen through her eyes , how it looked and interact with things .
The time that we focused on is something we value and expect for the entire year .
Recently , on a trip , we &apos;re walking , and my daughter suddenly stops the way , and it &apos;s only to the red <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that it &apos;s very much like when we &apos;re young in our previous trips .
It described me how it was five years old , and when she was right in the position .
It says that it &apos;s broken my heart , and it turns out that the <unk> of the <unk> for the first time was nine years .
And now what it sees in New York is that in the universities , because it decided to go to New York .
And I realized this is one of the most important things we &apos;ve created is memory .
So I want to share the idea of holding a role in making memories .
I don &apos;t know about you , but I don &apos;t know how you are , but this is 15 of these pictures , I don &apos;t appear so much in the family pictures .
I &apos;m always a photograph .
So today I want to encourage everybody to be in the photo , and don &apos;t really take that one step away from someone , and ask , &quot; Can you take a picture for us ? &quot;
Thank you .
I never forget my grandmother told me -- she died in the <unk> : &quot; Hey , let &apos;s fight <unk> . fight against him . &quot;
But don &apos;t ever turn into a <unk> form . &quot;
For two years , since the <unk> <unk> in Libya , then <unk> by the athletes waves from the <unk> and Egypt <unk> .
I was involved in the forces and outside Libya to make the date of the <unk> and to launch a <unk> <unk> <unk> regime .
And that &apos;s a great revolution .
The young men at the front of the front line demanded the right , raise the words of freedom , dignity , social justice .
They &apos;d be clear a mirror of the <unk> <unk> regime .
They showed a situation that was <unk> paint from east to west and stretched to the south .
Finally , six months of war on total war and all of the total of us , we managed to <unk> the country and <unk> the violence .
However , <unk> left a burden , a legacy of specialized government , corrupt and <unk> .
For four decades , the <unk> of <unk> has destroyed infrastructure and culture and the moral code of Libya .
The perception of destruction and challenges , I like many other women , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the civil society , calls the entire and transition process to democracy and reconciliation .
About 200 organizations were established at <unk> during that time and immediately after the <unk> collapsed -- almost 300 in <unk> .
Over the 33 years of <unk> , I went back to Libya , with my unique passion , I started training the training training training training , developing people in leadership .
And the same group of women , I started Parikrma Women John Women &apos;s <unk> , leaders from all different components in society , to lobby and to create our rights and peace and peace .
I was in a very difficult situation , a more <unk> , <unk> environment , which was a <unk> environment , and the <unk> of politics .
I led the first <unk> of Women Women John Women for Peace to lobby a comprehensive universal rule , which could provide to every citizen , whether they were , and they were in the best and the most important , and they were creating the <unk> .
Finally our creativity has been accepted and successfully successfully .
Women won <unk> percent of the <unk> House in the <unk> elections in the last 52 elections .
However , by a little bit , the excitement of the election and the revolution of the revolution disappears -- the moment we get through the <unk> of the violence .
One day we woke up with news about the <unk> of ancient <unk> and <unk> .
We were different from the day of the American union incident and the attack in the workforce .
The other day we woke up with the <unk> <unk> military soldiers .
And every day , each day we woke up with the rules of the civil forces and the <unk> of people with prisoners and their <unk> <unk> and <unk> regulations .
Our society , in fact , created by the revolutions , becomes more <unk> and left away from the ideal , the principles of freedom , dignity , social equality that we pursue .
<unk> , the categories and the hatred became the symbol of the <unk> .
I &apos;m here not to inspire you to the success story of making a <unk> list and elections .
And I &apos;m here to admit that we -- the whole country has chosen wrong , decided wrong .
We didn &apos;t prioritize the citizen rights .
Because election polls can &apos;t bring peace , stability or security for Libya .
Would the list of <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and women brought peace and reconciliation for the country ?
No , no .
So what did it do ?
Why is our social societies continue to be a <unk> and political society by the selfish politics of dominance and <unk> , by both men and females ?
Perhaps the absence of <unk> is not just about women &apos;s rights but the women &apos;s value , tolerance , and identity .
Our society needs a national dialogue and the <unk> to build more than the need to vote , which only enhances the polarization and divide .
Our society needs the presence of what the quality of the quality of the world is more than needed numbers and the number of the number of gender men .
We need to stop acting as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
We need to start acting like compassion of compassion and tolerance .
We need to develop a <unk> conversation that is not only honor but to practice <unk> instead of <unk> , plus <unk> , <unk> instead of <unk> .
These are the ideas that are needed to be a place that a country has been destroyed as Libya as a need to be able to <unk> peace .
Because peace is like <unk> , it needs to be in harmony , the <unk> between the boys and the females .
That &apos;s the real key .
And we needed to establish the element of living in front of the political side of the society .
According to a poem in the &quot; <unk> &quot; -- &quot; peace &quot; -- is the word God &apos;s word compassionate , <unk> .
The next , the word &quot; <unk> &quot; is known in the traditional tradition of the United States , the <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> of the female sex , the <unk> , the <unk> , from every tribe , all tribe , all the people .
And because the bow completely is developing in its gut , the <unk> <unk> of compassion that feeds the entire life .
So we &apos;re taught that &quot; Our tolerance <unk> all over . &quot;
So we &apos;re taught that &quot; Our tolerance is near the outrage . &quot;
May each one of us is the privilege of tolerance tolerance .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I went through a little bit like Alice in the <unk> .
The State State School teacher asked me , a teacher who teaches a coach to give a technical student .
I was scared .
It was really frightening . <unk> students , big books , and all the words were strange .
But when the exchange opened , I experienced that Alice had experience when she fell onto the cave and discovered the door to a new world .
That &apos;s just what I was given to talk about with my students . I was amazed in their ideas , and I wanted everyone else to be this <unk> experience .
I believe the key to opening the door to the world is the ability to communicate well .
We &apos;re incredibly involved with the same scientists and engineers to change the world .
<unk> and engineers are people who are dealing with the biggest challenges , from energy to the environment and the health , and also , if we don &apos;t know that and not understand that , it &apos;s not going to be done , and I believe that we don &apos;t
But the effects that are not going to happen if scientists and engineers don &apos;t get us to their home .
<unk> and engineers , please have eight things with us .
I want to share some key to do so to make sure that we saw the science of these charming , sexy , interesting , hot , hot people .
The first question is : What &apos;s the chance ?
Why science relates to us .
Don &apos;t just tell you that you &apos;ve been working on bone tissue , which is , you know , you &apos;ve been looking for bone tissue , it &apos;s like the grid making bone , and we &apos;re trying to learn that it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
When the science described science , be careful when you use the term .
The term that <unk> us understand the idea .
It can be said , &quot; <unk> and <unk> &quot; but not using &quot; <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
To make the idea that I was easy to understand is not to <unk> them .
Instead , as <unk> said : turn things as simple as possible , but don &apos;t make it simpler .
Obviously he could talk about the scientific problems that don &apos;t <unk> the idea .
So , in mind , for example , in terms of the idea , these are the ways that are drawn and making us enjoy what you &apos;re talking about .
And when you show you , don &apos;t use the <unk> .
Have you ever wondered why they were the <unk> brick ?
When the arrow <unk> ? <unk> is <unk> , killed all the time , and they &apos;ll kill his lecture .
So one slide like this , not very boring <unk> , but also dependent on the language of the brain , which led us to be <unk> .
Instead , this is the slide of <unk> Brown that actually understands the more . It shows the structure of the <unk> <unk> that it really inspired the original design of the <unk> Tower .
And the trick here is to use simple sentences and easy reader to be able to depend on that if they don &apos;t get along , and then use images of engaging images to help us understand what the data is .
I think this is just a few secrets to make us open that and see the <unk> of science and technology .
The engineers I work with teaching me to know -- <unk> things . So I &apos;d like to summarize with a equations .
Take the &quot; science &quot; off the line and the term &quot; term &quot; and then <unk> the <unk> of the audience , and then the &quot; passionate &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so , the scientists and engineers , when you go through this , you &apos;re talking about eight stories to me .
Thank you .
Hi . I &apos;m Cameron Russell , and over the short time I &apos;ve just had , I &apos;m a prototype .
Actually , in 10 years .
And I felt there was a uncomfortable pressure in the room right now because I was supposed to not wear this <unk> .
Luckily I had a different set of things .
This is the first time to have the first <unk> on the stage , so I think you &apos;re very fortunate to witness this .
If some women feel terrified when I showed up , you don &apos;t have to tell me right now , but I &apos;ll do it through Twitter .
I realized that I &apos;m very lucky to change what you think about me in 10 seconds .
Not everybody has an opportunity to do this .
The high heels are uncomfortable , and I &apos;m not going to take them .
The worst part is this <unk> of this <unk> shirt over because you &apos;re all smiling , so don &apos;t do anything when it &apos;s on my head .
All right .
Why did I do that ?
It &apos;s just a big thing .
In fact , hopefully it &apos;s not that <unk> as this picture .
<unk> have a huge power , but it &apos;s very fake .
I &apos;ve just changed exactly what you think about me in six seconds .
And in this picture , I haven &apos;t had any boys in real life .
I felt uncomfortable at that moment , and I had a photographer telling me to speak and put his hand on his hair .
And of course , except the operation , or the deep <unk> of the prosthetic <unk> that I have two days ago to take photography , there are very little things that we can do to change our appearance , and our appearance , even though it &apos;s a very large and <unk> ,
So today , to me , it &apos;s not nearly as afraid that you can &apos;t <unk> with real work .
And I stand on this stage because I &apos;m a model .
I stand on this stage because I was pretty beautiful , a white woman , and in the model , we call it a charming girl .
And I &apos;ll answer the questions that people ask me , but with real reality .
The first question was , how did I go to the model ?
And I always say , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m detected , but it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
I actually became a model because I won the genetic lottery , and I &apos;m a <unk> property , and maybe you ask what the product is , and maybe you ask what is the question .
In the last decade , we &apos;ve redefined beauty not just as healthy and young and <unk> and <unk> that we &apos;re programmed in the biology to crave for the <unk> , but the height , the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> .
This is the legacy that &apos;s built for me and that &apos;s the legacy I &apos;ve made on it .
I know that some of you are skeptical this point , and maybe some of the <unk> models are like , &quot; Wait . Naomi <unk> . Joan <unk> . &quot;
I want to praise your <unk> of your model . It &apos;s very impressive .
But unfortunately I had to tell you about 2007 , a Ph.D. in New York City that was statistically all the ones on the floor , and in <unk> , that <unk> was only 27 , less than four percent .
The next question that people ask me was , &quot; Can you become a model when you grow ? &quot;
And my first answer was : &quot; You don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not hiring . &quot;
But the next answer I really want to talk to these girls is , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Can you know what ? Can you be any one .
You can become president of the United States , or the one who invented the next Internet , or a poet surgeon , a <unk> surgeon , which is great , because you &apos;re going to be the first person .
If , after a fun list , they said , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; I would say , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; I would say , &quot; Please do your boss . &quot;
Because you have no power , you can be the editor of the <unk> magazine in the United States or the director of H &amp; amp ; M , or Steven <unk> .
Tell me that I wanted to be a model when I grew up , like I said you &apos;d like to win the lottery when you were growing up .
It &apos;s out of her control , and it &apos;s great , but it &apos;s not a career path .
I &apos;ll prove to you -- 10 years of the experience I can accumulate when I made a model , because it &apos;s not like the heart surgeon , so it &apos;s just a short time .
If the photographer is standing there , it &apos;s like a nice light , and when the client says , &quot; Cameron , you want the picture of you , &quot; and then you &apos;re going to go back , you can
This is like this .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> than the picture in the middle .
I don &apos;t know what happens during that .
It &apos;s a very tragic thing after you learn , you write <unk> and you &apos;ve done a few things , and you can &apos;t add more , because if you say you &apos;re going to be president of the United States , you &apos;re going to see you with a different
The next question that people ask me always ask me , &quot; Are all the photographs correct ? &quot;
Right , so close to all the photographs are edited , but it &apos;s just a small element of what &apos;s going on .
This is one of the first pictures I &apos;ve ever taken , and I was also the first time I took a picture , and I didn &apos;t even have a <unk> cycles .
I know that we &apos;re going into personal personal business , but I &apos;m a little girl .
This is my <unk> , taken her next to a few months .
This is me in the same day when I photographed the picture .
My friend &apos;s been with me .
This is me at a <unk> I was at a <unk> I was a few days before I photographed the French <unk> .
This is me with soccer <unk> in the magazine .
So here I am .
I hope you see -- these pictures are not pictures of me .
It &apos;s the images that are made up , and it &apos;s built by a bunch of experts , <unk> , <unk> experts , photographers , photographers , and they create this . It &apos;s not me .
The next question I &apos;m asked to ask is , &quot; What are you for free ? &quot;
I have a lot of high heels of heels that I never carry , so I &apos;m a exceptions , but the free stuff I get was the things that I was in real life , and that &apos;s what we didn &apos;t want to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and I went to the shop , and I forgot to bring it for money and they gave me free for free .
And so when I was a teenager , I sat a friend who was a terrible driver , and she crossed the red lamp , and we stopped , and all I did was say , &quot; Excuse the police , &quot; and we could
I have those free things that I &apos;m free to do because I &apos;m not , because I am , and people who are willing to spend money on their appearance , not because they are .
I lived in New York , and last year in 140 teenagers were caught and <unk> , and that was 86 percent black and Native people , most of the teenagers .
In New York , there were only 8,000 black people and <unk> , so for them , the question is not , &quot; Am I arrested ? &quot;
I &apos;m like , &quot; How many times do I get ? &quot;
When I was preparing to speak this talk , I found that 53 percent of the <unk> girls in America didn &apos;t like their body , and this was up to 78 percent when they were 17 .
The last question they ask me was , &quot; How is it like to be a model ? &quot;
I think what they want to hear is , &quot; If you lean a little bit thinner , and your hair <unk> more , you &apos;ll be happy and <unk> . &quot;
And when we were in the <unk> , we gave the sort of <unk> .
&quot; It &apos;s great to travel , and working with creative people , inspiring and enthusiasm . &quot;
And these are true , but it &apos;s only half of it , because what we never talked about before the lens , which I never talked about before the lens , is : &quot; I &apos;m insecure . &quot;
I was safe because I had to think about my image every day .
And you ever ask yourself , &quot; If your <unk> <unk> more than more than more than , therefore I &apos;ll be happier ? &quot;
You just meet a group of people , because they have the <unk> , and the most tenacious and wearing the most beautiful and they can be the most peaceful women on the planet .
When I wrote this speech , I felt very hard to find the balance , because one face , I felt very uncomfortable to come here to say , &quot; I &apos;ve got all this because I &apos;m feeling good enough to be in the way . &quot;
But it &apos;s mostly hard to take a legacy of gender and <unk> , while I &apos;m one of the greatest benefits .
But I &apos;m also happy to say , I think it &apos;s a very lucky to be , I think , I &apos;ve been in advance before I was 10 , 20 or 30 years away , and I &apos;ve worked with a lot of companies in my career , because I &apos;m not going to talk about how I &apos;m
If something else is going to stick in this talk , I hope it &apos;s all that we feel comfortable to inherit the power of the image in our success and our failure .
Thank you .
There are so many ways that people around us can help improve our lives .
We don &apos;t touch each person around , so there &apos;s a lot of wisdom that we can never know , even though we share the public spaces .
So the last few years , I &apos;m trying to create more ways to share with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like paper paper , paper paper and pollen .
And these projects come from questions I asked , like , like , my neighbor has to pay a lot of money for their apartments ?
How do we put our borrowing and borrow more things that don &apos;t tap at one another at the time ?
How do we share more than our memory of our buildings and abandoned buildings , and we understood what our landscape is about ?
And how do we share more than our hopes for the money of the money , so our communities can reflect our needs and dream for us today ?
Now , I live in New Orleans , and I &apos;m in love New Orleans .
The spirit is always <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , the ball of the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> who lived for hundreds of years , and I believe in the city that always makes music .
I felt like every time someone <unk> , New Orleans had a whole march .
The city has some most beautiful constructions in the world , but it has a number of largest value in the United States .
I live near this house , and I thought , how do I make it a more beautiful place for my community , and I think something that can change my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost a very loving person .
Her name was Joan , and she was a mother for me , and her death was unexpected and <unk> .
And I thought about death , and this made me feel deep for the time I &apos;ve had , and I gave a clear sense of what I &apos;ve had to do with my life now .
But I struggled to keep this angle of view in my everyday life .
I feel it &apos;s easy to capture the day of the day , and forget what really matters to you .
So with the help of the old friends and the new old , I turned one side of this abandoned building into a giant <unk> board , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , &quot; Before I die , I want to ... &quot; so anyone who &apos;s going to go through the <unk>
I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this trial , but on the next day , the wall was completely sealed , and it kept growing .
And I wanted to share something about what people wrote on that wall .
&quot; Before I die , I want to go and eat . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be on the footsteps of the International May . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I &apos;d like to sing for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to grow a tree . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to live outside the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to give her a hug again . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be <unk> .
&quot; Before I die , I &apos;d like to be totally myself . &quot;
So this <unk> space has become a <unk> space , and the hopes and dreams of others make me laugh , turn their eyes , and they comfort me throughout my tough times .
It &apos;s about knowing that you don &apos;t just have one yourself .
It &apos;s about understanding people around us in new ways and <unk> .
It &apos;s about creating space for the reflection and the testing , and remember what really means most to us when we grow and change .
I &apos;ve been doing this project last year , and I started getting hundreds of letters from people who want to make a wall in their communities , so the <unk> , the <unk> , and I do a tool , and now the walls are being done in the world .
Together , we &apos;ve shown out how powerful our public spaces are , maybe if we get to give the opportunity to have a voice and share more with somebody else .
Two important things we have is time and our relationship with others .
In the age of increasing our diffusion , it &apos;s more important than ever to figure out how to maintain the angle and remember that life is short and soft .
What death is that we don &apos;t usually get permission to talk about or even thinking about , but I &apos;m realizing that preparing death is one of the most powerful things you can do .
Think about death as well as you can .
Our shared spaces can be better reflected to what happens to us as individuals and as a community , and more ways to share our hope , our fears and stories , and our people around us can lead to the world .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Well , I did mathematics and this is a very unusual issue for anybody to do mathematics , which is that we &apos;re like consultants consultants .
Nobody knew what the hell we were doing .
So I &apos;m going to try to explain to you today .
Well dance is one of the activities that people often do .
We love the master dancer and the next <unk> <unk> you &apos;ll see later .
<unk> <unk> requires a special and technical level of technical and technical skill that is relevant to the subject that are relevant .
Sadly , neurological disorders like Parkinson &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s going to work on this particular ability , as it is happening for my friend <unk> <unk> , who once , was a great artist .
For the last few years there was a huge improvement in the treatment .
However , <unk> million people in the globe have a disease , and they have to live in debilitating <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and other symptoms with the disease . What we need is the tools for the better target .
We need to measure progress as objective , and ultimately , the only way we know that when we really have a cure , is that we have a very accurate approach to answer .
But it &apos;s really frustrating that with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movements , they don &apos;t have a biological footprint , so there &apos;s no <unk> testing in which you can do , and the best way we have this <unk> test .
You need to go to the hospital to do it . It &apos;s very expensive , which means this <unk> is out of clinical trials , it &apos;s never been done .
But if the patient can do this test at home ?
It would really be really , really , really , a trip to the clinic , and if the patient can do the test , what ?
It &apos;s not a <unk> time of the employees .
Only about $ 300 , to make this test at the <unk> <unk> lab .
So what I want to propose to you is that the traditional way of doing this is to achieve this , because you see , at least in some direction , we &apos;re all masters as <unk> <unk> . My friend .
Here we have a video of the <unk> that are vibrating .
The <unk> of this is healthy and someone &apos;s saying , and we can see ourselves like <unk> <unk> , because we have to coordinate all the <unk> agencies when we make the sound , and we &apos;re all in the world .
It &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> that needs to be trained .
I mean , think about how long it took a kid to say .
From sound , we can actually track the position of <unk> <unk> when the <unk> are <unk> , and when the <unk> are affected by Parkinson &apos;s , the organs are also getting too young .
So at the bottom graph , you can see an example of the <unk> of the <unk> .
We see all the same symptoms .
We see the shake , debilitating and <unk> .
The word is more and more popular than a period of time , and that &apos;s one of the symptoms of it .
And this can be really hard to detect , in some cases , but with any digital digital digital , and using a functional voice analysis that &apos;s <unk> with the most new machine , modern technology , and using a voice .
So how do you make trials based on this voice comparing the same as a professional clinical trial ? They both <unk> each other .
So the <unk> of neuroscience is <unk> . They use existing infrastructure .
You don &apos;t have to design a new hospital system to come out this experiment .
And they &apos;re all right . But more of them , testing , are based on a very <unk> voice .
That means it can be done .
<unk> speed , it takes about 30 seconds .
The cost of <unk> costs , and we all know what happens .
When something becomes extremely cheap , it will be widely available .
So here &apos;s some wonderful targets I think we could do now .
We can reduce the hard problem for the patient .
It doesn &apos;t have to go to the clinic for a test .
We can do observations at the high frequency for data to get the data targeted .
We can do this with a huge cost of frugal cost to do clinical trials , <unk> on the population of the population being possible for the first time .
We had the opportunity to begin to look for initial biological footprint before it was too late .
So to do these first steps to go this way , we &apos;re presenting a <unk> <unk> .
With <unk> and <unk> , we aim at recording a voice that &apos;s a very large number of quantities across the globe to gather data and started to process four targets .
We have the local residential residential <unk> that can access to three quarter of the planet on the planet .
Anyone who &apos;s healthy or expensive may call it to cheap prices , and to leave it back , several cents per time , and I &apos;m really excited that we &apos;ve met six percent of the target of eight hours .
Thank you .
Tom <unk> : So Max , by taking all of the models for 10,000 people , can you tell you who is healthy and who ?
What would you conclude from these samples ?
Max <unk> : Yeah . Yes , it &apos;s going to happen , when you call you a disease or <unk> .
You see , some people can &apos;t do that . Maybe they don &apos;t call it .
But we &apos;re going to take a huge amount of data that collected data from all the different instances , and the results are in different ways , because then we &apos;re looking at the <unk> of the <unk> , and we &apos;re looking for the actual effects of this disease .
So what is the accuracy of 86 percent ?
That &apos;s more than that .
In fact , my students <unk> , I have to praise him , because he did some wonderful work , he proved that this could be done through the mobile phone , that allowed this project to be done , and the accuracy is coming to 99 percent .
Nine nine . Yeah , one <unk> .
So , what that means is that people will — people can call out their cellphone phones and do this test , and people who have Parkinson &apos;s voice can call their own <unk> , and then doctors can test their own well-being , and they &apos;re going to
Exactly .
Thank you very much . <unk> <unk> Max <unk> .
Thank you very much , Tom .
I live in the southern Central .
This is the <unk> area : alcohol stores , food food , <unk> land .
So makers have cities together and they &apos;re going to change the name of the Middle Central and they &apos;re going to make a difference . So they &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> of Los Angeles , as if that will solve the real problems that are actually going to happen .
This is the South Angeles area .
<unk> stores , food food , <unk> .
Just like <unk> million Americans , I lived in a desert desert desert in the L.A. Desert , the home of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and ran running .
What &apos;s interesting is that fast food is killing more people than <unk> , and running .
In the South Angeles in Los Angeles , people are dying of diseases that are being curable .
For example , obesity rates in the region are five times five times more than Beverly Hills , which is 16 kilometers away .
I get bored when I got to witness this .
And I wondered , how do you feel when there is no food benefits , when every time you go out of your door you have to see the bad effects that the food systems are present today ?
I saw the wheelchair being sold as the same car .
I see blood centers grow as much as Starbucks .
And I realized that that had to stop .
I realized that the problem is the solution .
The food is the problem and the food is also the solution .
For me , I &apos;m tired of driving a 45 minutes to drive an apple which is not so <unk> .
What I did was I was growing a <unk> forest in front of my house .
It &apos;s on a piece of land that we call a <unk> path .
It &apos;s <unk> , long , long .
The problem is , that land belongs to the city .
But you have to keep it .
So I thought , &quot; Great . I can do what I want , because that &apos;s my responsibility and I have to keep it . &quot;
And this is how I would keep that land .
I joined my team , the blue soil , we came together and started growing the <unk> forest : the fruit , you know , all the nine fruits .
We &apos;re a group that shares <unk> , including people who do gardens from many different lives , from every city in the city , and they &apos;re going to be free , and everything we &apos;re free for free .
And the garden , it &apos;s beautiful .
Then there was complaining .
So the city came to see me , and sort of giving me a tech , I asked myself to break the garden . That &apos;s later <unk> .
And I was like , &quot; Come on , really ? &quot;
A <unk> of the building , in the <unk> , people don &apos;t bother to care about ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Okay . Come to this . &quot;
Because this time , this is not coming .
And then the L.A. Times received , Steve <unk> wrote a paper about it , and he said to the <unk> Parliament , and then one of the members of the blue soil would send a <unk> on <unk> and with a <unk> , we succeeded .
We had a victory in our hands .
That council commissioner even called it and said they were <unk> and liked what we were doing .
I mean , come , why not ?
The U.S. leading American <unk> of the wilderness , which is the city of ownership .
They owned 42 square square kilometers of land .
That &apos;s 20 times the center of the center .
It &apos;s enough to grow <unk> million tomato crops .
How can they disagree ?
<unk> a tree for you -- 10,000 seeds .
When the green line costs you a dollar , you measure the equivalent of about 75 dollars .
That &apos;s my faith , and when I tell people , let &apos;s grow food for myself .
<unk> food for you is the same kind of printing order .
I have a legacy in the South Central .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
And I refuse to do part of the fact that was made up , which was created for me by some other people , and I was creating reality in my own .
I &apos;m an artist .
<unk> is my art . I grew up my work .
Just as a painter , the <unk> for the walls , I <unk> for the lawn , the commute .
I used a piece of garden , which is planted like a canvas , and plant trees and blue trees are what I <unk> for that fabric .
You will be surprised with what the soil would do if you turn them into a fabric .
You can &apos;t imagine how wonderful the Great <unk> is , and how they affect people .
So what happened ?
I watched my <unk> into a <unk> tool , a tool for the transformation of my region .
To change the community , you have to change the part of the soil .
We &apos;re the soil .
You will be surprised when the babies affected .
<unk> is the best and most challenging thing you can do , especially in the inner .
In addition , you &apos;re getting <unk> .
I remember once , there was a mother and daughter came , and at the time , it was about 10 : 30 p.m. and they were in the garden of my mouth and I went out and they were really ashamed .
I thought , oh my God , I feel so bad because they &apos;re in the name and I tell them , two of you know , don &apos;t have to do that .
This is the place of the <unk> that &apos;s on the road .
I feel embarrassed to see someone in the near me who is still hungry . And that &apos;s more than possible to do this . People ask me , &quot; <unk> , you &apos;re not afraid that you &apos;re going to steal your food steal . &quot;
I said , &quot; Of course , no , I &apos;m not afraid they &apos;re going to steal .
So they &apos;re in the street .
The whole idea is that .
I want them to take them , but at the same time , I want them to get my health back . &quot;
And once I was working in a homeless neighborhood in the Los Angeles Center .
And there were a couple of men , and they helped me <unk> from the delivery truck .
The air was so happy , and they shared stories about the piece of their garden that had impacted them and they used to grow their mothers , and she was in front of them , and it was amazing that this idea had changed them , and it was just a
So the green soil went on to grow about 20 parts of the garden .
We had about 50 people to participate in the training , and they were voluntary .
If the kids planted <unk> , they &apos;ll eat <unk> .
If they grow tomato , they &apos;ll eat tomato .
But if none of them showed them that , if they don &apos;t see the impact of food to the brain and the body , they &apos;re blind to eat anything that is laid in front of us .
I see young people who want to be working , but they &apos;re getting engaged with something -- I see the kids that are colorful and they &apos;re just walking in the road that they were already located , not where they were .
With the garden , I see an opportunity that we can guide the kids to take their own community , and there &apos;s a sustainable life .
And when we do that , who knows ?
Maybe we &apos;ll manufacture George Washington Washington , next .
But if we don &apos;t change the world , we never will .
This is one of my plans . This is what I want to do .
I wanted to grow a garden where people can share food .
I want to take out the lines and turn them into a <unk> for health .
Don &apos;t get me wrong .
I &apos;m not talking about free stuff , because free is unsustainable .
The really interesting thing about sustainability , it &apos;s that you have to maintain it .
I &apos;m talking about serving people , and pulling them out of the street , and giving them a joy , pride and joy when their own food grow , open farmers .
What I want to do here , we &apos;ll make it so sexy .
I want all of us to become <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
We &apos;ll change the concept of <unk> .
If you &apos;re not a <unk> , you &apos;re not <unk> .
Do you with your <unk> , okay ?
And turn it into the air you choose .
Basically , if you want to meet me , you know , if you want to meet , don &apos;t call me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and join the meeting where you talk about this , you &apos;re doing something about it .
If you want to meet me , let &apos;s go out with your <unk> , and you &apos;re going to grow something .
Hi . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya the South Park of the country .
The next axis is my father &apos;s <unk> , and the <unk> , was the <unk> Park .
The National Republic of the <unk> <unk> on the south , which means wild animals like horse <unk> escape from the park .
And so animals like lions followed them , and this is what lions do .
They kill our cattle .
This is one of the cows that was killed in the evening , and when I woke up in the morning I found it dead , and I felt very sad , because that &apos;s the only male bull that we had .
My community , <unk> , believe we &apos;re from heaven along with all of our animals and all the land to keep them , which is why we &apos;re so critical to value them .
So I grew up with <unk> hatred .
The fighters <unk> us and the livestock , and also very concerned about this .
So they killed lions .
This is one of six lions that was killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is the reason that lions in the hospital had very little left .
Every son son son , six to nine years old , in my community , is held responsibility to keep his father &apos;s cows , and I have to do the same .
So I had to figure out how to address this .
The first idea that I had was the use of fire , because I thought of a <unk> .
But then I realized that nature wasn &apos;t really working , because it even helped the lion see <unk> .
But I didn &apos;t give up . I kept thinking .
And my second idea is to use the <unk> .
I tried to trick those lions , &#91; to &#93; the <unk> , and I was standing close to the cows .
But lions are very clever .
They &apos;re going to day and they &apos;re looking at the <unk> , and then they come back , but the second day they come back , and they &apos;re saying that this stuff doesn &apos;t move , it always stayed there .
And then the lion jumped in and killed the cattle .
So one night , I took a <unk> and I walked around the <unk> , and that day , these lions don &apos;t come .
I discovered that the lion is <unk> .
So I had a concept .
Since I was a kid , I was working in my room for a day , and I started to open my mother &apos;s radio radio , and she was almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electricity .
So I took a car -- an old car car <unk> , and it was a little device found in the car , and it helped the driver the <unk> to be effective when they wanted to turn the left left .
And I get a switch to be able to turn off and to turn lights up .
And it &apos;s a little light from a <unk> .
And I put everything .
As you can see , the solar panel uses to <unk> , and <unk> power power gives energy for the <unk> card . I call it the <unk> .
And the clock card dropped for the light light .
As you can see , the lightbulbs are out there , because that &apos;s the lion <unk> .
And that &apos;s how light goes to the lion when they arrive at night late .
The lights turn off and <unk> the lion to make them think that I was going around the <unk> , but actually I was sleeping on my bed .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve been putting it in my home two years ago , since then , we &apos;re not having any problems with lions .
The families were listening to tell me about this idea .
One of them is this lady .
She had a lot of cattle killed , and she asked me if I could help her build electric bulbs .
I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
So I put the lights . You can see that behind them , they &apos;re lions .
So far , I &apos;ve been able to install for seven families in their community , and they work effectively .
Now my idea has been used all over Kenya to try to get rid of other meat animals like hyena , newspapers , and it also used to be used to death from the farmer &apos;s farm .
This invention , I was lucky enough to learn to stay in one of the best schools in Kenya , the <unk> <unk> , and I was really excited about this .
My new school is starting to help by raising and raise awareness .
I even led my friends of my community , and we &apos;ve been installing lights for families who are not access to it and I teach them how to build them .
A year ago , I was just a boy in a <unk> <unk> for my father , I used to see flying airplanes , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;m going to be sitting inside .
And I &apos;m here today .
I had the opportunity to come here by the first time to join TED .
My biggest dream was to become an aircraft engineer and pilots growing up .
I had hated lions , but now because of my invention , I was saving the <unk> and lions , we could live with lions without any conflict .
<unk> <unk> . In my language , it means thank you so much .
I don &apos;t know how interesting it is to hear your story .
So you &apos;ve got this scholarship . Yes .
You &apos;re doing other inventions on the other side .
What are the invention of your list ?
And I &apos;m going to leave you , you want to make a wire wire .
I know that the wires that were invented , but I wanted to do my own .
She tried , right , and she -- she &apos;s got to be a little bit of <unk> .
Richard <unk> , she was different .
We &apos;re going to ride the grandchildren on the road , you &apos;re a little .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
What I do , and what I did , <unk> life , was shaped for seven years , working in Africa as a young child .
From <unk> to <unk> , I was young , not — I worked in Zambia , Kenya , <unk> Coast , Algeria , Somalia , in collaboration with the African countries with African countries .
I worked for the NGO of Italy , and every project we created in Africa .
I was so thankful .
Now , 21 years old , I think , Italian people , and we &apos;re doing good work in Africa .
But instead , we killed everything that we were running into .
The first project , which inspired my first book , &quot; <unk> of <unk> <unk> , &quot; which is a project in which the Italian decides to teach the <unk> .
So we &apos;re in southern Zambia with seeds from Italy in Italy in a beautiful valley , and we teach people the <unk> of Italian Italian and Italian and <unk> .
Of course , people who are most of these people who are very interested in doing this work , so we paid them , and sometimes they &apos;re getting to work .
We &apos;re really surprised about the indigenous , in the <unk> Valley of <unk> like this .
But instead of asking them , they didn &apos;t grow anything , we simply said , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
&quot; Just get there to saving the <unk> of starvation . &quot;
And of course , everything in Africa has grown well .
We have these fantastic , <unk> . In Italy , a tomato carrot is about this size . In Zambia , it &apos;s big to this size .
It &apos;s unbelievable , and we &apos;re telling the people , &quot; People see this <unk> . &quot;
When the tomato results start coming , nine , and the red , they just passed one night , like 200 of the <unk> from the river to come up and clean them up .
We said to the &quot; <unk> , &quot; my God , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And the people say , &quot; Well , that &apos;s why we didn &apos;t grow anything here . &quot;
&quot; So why don &apos;t you tell us before ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve never asked . &quot;
I thought that every single person in Africa is <unk> , but then when I look at what Americans do , the people who are doing , and the French people , and after seeing what they do , I feel a little bit more proud of my project .
Because , you see , we &apos;re also feeding the <unk> .
You should look at something disgusting -- you should look at something that we &apos;ve given for Africans who are not unexpected .
You want to read the book , read &quot; The <unk> <unk> , &quot; wrote by <unk> <unk> , a woman economist .
The book was invented in 2009 .
We , the Western aid funded has brought to Africa <unk> two billion of the U.S. <unk> in the last 50 years .
I wouldn &apos;t tell you what the money was doing .
Take reading her book .
Reading it from a woman who &apos;s in Africa , the damage we &apos;ve been making .
Westerners like us are the <unk> , the <unk> , and we only have two ways to treat other people : or support , or protect the <unk> .
Two words from &quot; Latin &quot; <unk> , &quot; which means &quot; to do dad . &quot;
Those are different things that are made .
<unk> , I treat anyone from another culture as if they were my kid . &quot; I love them too . &quot;
<unk> , I treat everybody from other cultures as they were with me .
That &apos;s why white <unk> in Africa is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; he .
I was like to be a slap when I read the book , &quot; The boy , but the beautiful thing , &quot; wrote by <unk> , said , above all , in economic growth , if people don &apos;t need help , let &apos;s wear them .
This should be a <unk> principle for aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
This morning , who organized a <unk> , is a <unk> , and said , &quot; Can we take a <unk> in a city that is not a new <unk> ? &quot;
When I was 27 , I decided to just affect people and I made a system called <unk> <unk> , where you would not start anything you never really push anyone , but becoming a very <unk> man , who was a <unk> , who wanted to be a better person .
So you <unk> your mouth .
Never brought to a community with ideas , you sit with the <unk> .
We don &apos;t work from the office .
We met at coffee cafe . <unk> alcohol .
We have no infrastructure .
And what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re going to be friends , and figure out what that person wants to do .
The most important one is desires .
You can give someone a thought .
If that person didn &apos;t want to do it , then you have to do it ?
The desire for women has for its growth is the most important thing .
The real aspiration of men has the most important thing .
And we helped them explore the insights , because nobody in the world can achieve one .
The idea of not really has the idea , but the understanding of it is always present .
So many years ago , I had this idea : Why not , just once , to a community , and talk to people where there should be , how do we not , hear them ? But not only do we hear it .
Let me tell you a secret .
There &apos;s a problem in community meetings .
Those entrepreneurs who never come to date , and they don &apos;t even know how they are , in the community meeting , what they want to do with their money , the chance they &apos;ve just figured out .
So plan have a blind spot .
It &apos;s never known for you to know , and you don &apos;t even know them , because they don &apos;t come to public meetings .
What we do is work <unk> and to do that , you have to create a kind of existing social structure that doesn &apos;t exist .
You have to create a new field .
A new industry is like a family doctor for business , a family doctor for jobs , who sat with you in your home , at the table in the cafe , at the cafe , and you &apos;re going to find resources that are required to make a way to make a living
I started like a <unk> experiment , West Australia .
I &apos;m going to have a philosophy at the time , trying to get away from the way that the <unk> care is comes and tells you what to do .
So what I did in my first year in <unk> was just in the road , and for three days , I had my first clients -- a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and I was going to give him a <unk> ?
And I &apos;m going to help these fish know how to work together and sell these <unk> tuna , not for the <unk> <unk> , and then we &apos;ve got to find a way to sell them to Japan for 15 dollars , and we
In one year , I had 27 <unk> projects and the government to come to me asking me , &quot; How did you do that ?
And he did the <unk> ? &quot; And I said , &quot; I did something that was hard .
I was going to silence , and listen to them . &quot;
So the government says to me , &quot; Go ahead . &quot;
We &apos;ve been doing this for 300 communities around the world .
We helped the 40,000 jobs to eat .
There was a new business generation who was exhausted because of isolation .
Peter <unk> , one of the most great held <unk> of history , died when 96 , a few years ago .
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before working in business involved , and this is what Peter <unk> says : &quot; <unk> is not going to like a society and an entrepreneurship economy . &quot;
<unk> is a deadly marriage for entrepreneurs .
So right now you &apos;re rebuilding the <unk> that you &apos;re not aware of what the most smartest people in what want to do with the money of their <unk> .
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you .
You have to give them security , private , you have to be really excited to help them , and they will come , and they go , and they go in .
With a population 10,000 people , we may have about 200 clients .
Can you imagine a 400,000 , <unk> , <unk> , aspiration of <unk> .
What kind of PowerPoint theory is you in this morning ?
<unk> , <unk> people . They are friends you &apos;ve <unk> for prize .
So what I &apos;m talking about is <unk> <unk> is where it is present .
We are at the end of the last great revolution of the Industrial revolution with the <unk> of the <unk> , and disruptive , we have these unsustainable systems .
The engine burned in unsustainable .
The way the <unk> <unk> is unsustainable .
What we have to look at is how to nurture , treat , education , move and communicate to seven billion people in sustainability .
There &apos;s no technology to do that .
How good is it that the technology is going to invent the technology for the Green revolution ? <unk> ? Forget !
<unk> ? Forget !
It will be the names , and they are doing it right now .
There was a very , very happy story that I read in a <unk> magazine for years ago .
There &apos;s a group of experts invited up to discuss the future of New York City in <unk> .
And in <unk> , the group of people gathering together , and interviewing what happened to New York City in the next 100 years , and the final conclusion was : New York City will not be around for 100 years .
So , why is it that they look at the line on line and say , if the population has grown this scale , to move a population of the New York City , they will have to be in the <unk> of the horse , and the waste from six million horses are not there .
They will be crushed with <unk> .
So in <unk> , they saw this <unk> technology , which made the life in New York City .
So what happened ? In the next 40 years , to the time in the beginning of 1900 , there was about <unk> company company .
The idea for a different technology has been entirely <unk> up on top of all and there &apos;s very small factories in the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> . Henry Ford .
However , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First , you have to give them security .
No , they wouldn &apos;t find it to you .
Then you have to bring them an absolute service , and you &apos;re particularly <unk> and <unk> .
And then you have to tell them the fact of business .
The smallest company , the largest company , has to be capable of working on three wonderful things : what the product you want to sell is perfect , you have to have a great marketing , you have to have a great marketing governance .
Think about it ?
We &apos;ve never met one individual in the world , who just can make it , sell it and also run money at the same time .
That doesn &apos;t exist .
This animal has never been born .
We did a study , and we looked at 100 companies in the world of Carnegie Hall , <unk> , Edison , Ford , all new companies , Google , Yahoo .
Only one thing that all companies do in the world have , one thing : not one company started with one person .
We now teach the <unk> <unk> <unk> at <unk> , and we started the first class by giving them the first two first first <unk> of the biography of Richard <unk> , and the work for these <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> , and how many times Richard <unk> has been using the words
Never ever had words from &quot; Me , &quot; and the word &quot; we &quot;
He didn &apos;t start alone .
<unk> who started a company . Nobody .
So we can create a community where there are <unk> <unk> who are in the <unk> of business business sitting in the cafe , the pub , and those who are friends who are going to be asking you , &quot; What do you need ? &quot;
Can you do anything ? You can do it ?
Can you sell it ? Can you charge it ? You can run money ?
&quot; Oh , no , I can &apos;t do this . &quot; Do you want me to look for somebody else for you ? &quot;
We activate communities .
We have these <unk> volunteers help -- they help for the resources and humans , and we discovered that the magic of the human intelligence is like you can take the <unk> and the economic experience of the community , and we have the <unk> of the
Thank you .
For March , 2011 , I made the <unk> <unk> in New York City .
We &apos;re the <unk> .
It &apos;s not the windows , and it &apos;s basically avoiding sunlight .
We made the more thinner , more beautiful , turning the <unk> , and we were always getting <unk> in the newspapers , but we also have incredible artists with a years of experience and <unk> .
In November of 2011 , I was watching the world &apos;s situation at home , and I saw tragic events happening in Japan .
Then , the volunteer organization I joined in <unk> <unk> <unk> , for a few days , went to school school effort .
I , with hundreds of volunteers who understand that couldn &apos;t sit at home , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
On May 13 , I was looking for the <unk> town .
It &apos;s a little <unk> village in <unk> , with population about 50,000 people , one of the first places that are affected by the tsunami .
This level of water here is recorded until over 24 meters , and three miles deeper in the land .
Maybe the town is devastated .
We pulled fragments from channel channel , the <unk> hole
<unk> up the school , sanitation , <unk> , ready for innovation and rehabilitation .
We cleaned up tons of <unk> and <unk> from local <unk> .
We <unk> <unk> , but everybody &apos;s happy .
For weeks , volunteers and local people were looking for things .
They were looking for photos and film and <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s all done .
They &apos;ve been collecting and talking they were talking to stay around the markets around the markets .
It &apos;s not that that point that I &apos;ve learned is that these pictures are a very large part of the very big <unk> in these people .
When we run the wave , we kept the critic , they left it , and everything was left behind .
At the end of the first week there , I went to help a <unk> center in town .
I got rid of the water of the water , the <unk> <unk> .
This is where the <unk> centers has gathered the pictures .
This is where people talk , and that particular day I &apos;m going to be honored , because they trust me that I &apos;m going to help them clean the pictures .
It was so dynamic and exciting . Before that , I heard it was <unk> , but only when I was experiencing this new new music happened .
When I look at pictures , there are a couple of images over a hundred years old , some still in the envelope from the <unk> . I think , as a politician I can do that , and I know , I know , hundreds of other people can do this .
So I went to Facebook , and I went to Facebook and I asked a few people , and I got to the morning , I got a lot of positive feedback , I know I had to go .
We started to edit these pictures .
This is the first panel .
There &apos;s no shortage of damage , but the water is <unk> by the face of the girl , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> .
If not , girls in the image will not look like me anymore , and certainly it &apos;s as bad as the image of the picture .
In the time , in fact , a lot of images that were <unk> about , and we needed to add <unk> , so again , I went to Facebook and <unk> , and I was going to find 80 people like 12 different countries .
Within two weeks , I had 150 people who wanted to join .
In Japan , in July , we expanded the neighboring town of <unk> , far beyond the north town .
Every week , we installed our equipment in a makeshift <unk> library that we &apos;ve set up , so people come to see their photos .
And the older women who are sometimes not seen a scanner , but after 10 minutes , find their lost picture , gave us a scan , to download a <unk> , to download by a <unk> , a stranger , somewhere in the world , and we &apos;re starting to
Time has spent to restore the whole state of the state , and obviously depends on the <unk> of the image .
It could take an hour . It might take a week .
It might take months .
This is the <unk> in this photo that &apos;s almost been made by hand , or <unk> , from the sharp and detailed parts that are not yet harmed .
It takes time .
Now , all these pictures have been damaged by water , degraded <unk> in the saltwater , covered by bacteria , in the water , sometimes in the oil , for a time so long they &apos;re going to continue to keep on .
We can &apos;t fix if images don &apos;t clean , dry them and innovate .
We were lucky with <unk> the image with hands .
There &apos;s a wonderful <unk> that guide us .
It &apos;s very easy to do any damage for the images that may hurt .
My team <unk> once said this : It &apos;s like a tattoo for someone .
You don &apos;t have a fallacy .
The women brought us these photographs , and they &apos;ve been lucky , when they &apos;re recovered .
She <unk> them and stopped it when he realized she was doing more damage .
You also have the <unk> of the image .
If not , as your husband and her face , will never be possible , can only put them together in another <unk> , and <unk> the entire picture .
When I got back the images from us , she shared a little bit of their story .
These pictures were made by her colleagues who found in a <unk> , between the <unk> of the long way from home , and they realized him .
The day that happens tsunami , he was responsible for the <unk> .
He had to go about the water channel when the <unk> fell .
Two little boys , no longer , two boys are at school , two different schools .
One of the people is trapped in the water .
It took a week , she found them and knew that they all survived .
I paid her back on her , and I was also a son of her son &apos;s son 14 .
For her , after all , these pictures were perfect gifts for him , something that could look back , to remember the past of the past , not yet before that March , when the entire life was in the <unk> or destroyed .
After six months in Japan , <unk> volunteers joined the <unk> <unk> , where hundreds of people had been <unk> <unk> than <unk> , most of them had been <unk> .
Over the year , the hundred hundred volunteers were paid to give more than 90 families , hundreds of images had been completely recovered and correct .
In this time , we didn &apos;t spend a thousand dollars for equipment and materials , and most of the cost is the ink ink .
We take a continuous photo .
Each picture that suggests someone or something , one place , a relationship , one of the loved ones .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> and narratives , which is the last thing we &apos;re going to have to do with the first and the first thing we turn back .
That &apos;s what this entire project means , restoring the pieces of humanity , bringing the connections back to somebody .
When a photograph like this was returned , it would create a huge twist in the human life .
It also makes a huge difference in the lives of the <unk> .
For some people , they were connected to something big , to go to something , using their own talents for something more than <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
I wanted to read a email to close this talk from <unk> , which was from <unk> , who sent me back from Japan after six months .
&quot; When I worked , I can &apos;t think of every single body and the stories that contain inside of the pictures .
There was a photo , photographing generations of women in the home , from aged up to young children , gathered around a baby , hit me because I had a similar picture , my grandmother , my mother , and the picture of the family
There is the bridge , no matter how powerful , our basic need are the same , right ? &quot;
Thank you .
I was close to <unk> below a <unk> mine in Ghana .
The air is <unk> and it &apos;s a bit hot , and it &apos;s very hard to breathe .
I can feel the <unk> from the shadows body body , and I can &apos;t see it more .
I heard sounds , but almost the <unk> was the mix of a sound and the stone stone <unk> .
As people , I put up a low-cost <unk> for the first time , which is embedded into the old rubber ring , and I can barely see the <unk> <unk> walls of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
When I was <unk> , I had no idea that the New <unk> had a couple days ago who fell and fell fell and fell down the basement .
When I talk to you today , these people are still in that hole , risk lives without salaries or T.B. , and often die .
I was <unk> out of that hole , and it was home , but they would never get home , because it was <unk> .
Over the last 28 years , I collect cultural literature in over 70 countries , and in 2009 I had the greatest <unk> to the <unk> <unk> at Vancouver <unk> .
In the incredible incredible people I met there , I met a advocate for the <unk> <unk> , which is a master &apos;s chief to kill the <unk> of modern slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and I really started looking at slavery because I knew that it existed in the world , but it &apos;s not that extent .
After the talk , I felt so awful and I was really embarrassed by the ignorance of this <unk> in my life , and I thought , &quot; I don &apos;t know what ? &quot;
It started <unk> , so a couple of weeks later , I flew to Los <unk> to meet the <unk> <unk> and asked them to help .
And so it started the journey into the modern world world .
<unk> , I &apos;ve been to a lot of these places .
Some places I refer to like my house .
But this time , I &apos;d like to see the fact that the truth is being <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> that we know that there are over 27 million people being displaced in the world today .
That &apos;s twice as many people are displaced from Africa during the <unk> selling the Atlantic Ocean .
150 years ago , a slave was three times the size of a U.S. worker .
That &apos;s the equivalent of 50,000 U.S. dollars today .
But today , many of the generations of families are being caught through many generations of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s amazing , the slaves produce a better cost of a dollar <unk> billion dollars per year worldwide .
Many people are fooled by the <unk> of education , better work , just to feel that I was arrested under <unk> violence , and not escape .
This is the current news that &apos;s serving the trade , the <unk> that the slaves create value , but the people who create them are <unk> .
<unk> is almost like anywhere in the world , though it &apos;s illegal everywhere .
In India and Nepal , I was sent to a <unk> .
This beautiful , beautiful <unk> landscape is like going into the <unk> or <unk> world .
It &apos;s been more <unk> than minus 1.7 , the men , women , children , all family , all families , all of the families , are caught up in the <unk> , and they &apos;re taking them down to the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> and <unk> , they shut up and forth and forth and over again to 16 or 17 hours per day .
There was no food , it took hours to eat , because it was <unk> water .
<unk> and dust everywhere all over the place that my camera was so hot that my camera was so hot that the wheel turned .
For 20 minutes , I had to run back to the field of the field to wipe equipment and to get them under the thermostat for them , and then , in the air , I think , my camera is being treated much better than the other people .
Come back to the <unk> , I just wanted to cry , but the <unk> <unk> next to my <unk> and said , &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . Don &apos;t do this here . &quot;
He explained that emotion is very dangerous in this place , not for me , but for them .
I couldn &apos;t help them .
I didn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I don &apos;t have to do that .
I can put them in the situation where they &apos;re far worse than their current .
I have to rely on the <unk> <unk> to operate in the system to liberate them , and I believe they can .
For me , it &apos;s just come to the way to come to the house to really feel pain .
In the Himalayas , I found children from many miles of mountains down the van down the van waiting down the road .
The grand ones are bigger than the kids carrying them , the kids lifted up their <unk> using the <unk> of sticks , rope and fabric .
<unk> things are too heavy .
How can we create this <unk> , and this is what happens ?
Some people don &apos;t even know themselves being turned into their slaves , they work not 16 , 17 hours per day , because they just know that .
They have nothing to compare .
When this villagers , the <unk> were free , their homes were burning .
They were not going to have any , they were dead , they wanted to be , but the women in the middle of the town <unk> and calls for people tenacity , and they were paid for free .
We often think about sexual sexual trade when we hear the word &quot; slavery , &quot; and by this collective sense , I was very informed to work safely in the <unk> industry .
In <unk> , I was sent by the women who used sex .
They took me down to a little stairs down the dirty basement , in the light light .
This is actually not the <unk> .
It &apos;s more like a restaurant .
<unk> restaurants , like all of them , are known in the industry , are the locations of commercial trade .
Every place that has a small room , where the slaves , the women , the same children , are <unk> , are forced to be <unk> to customers , for example , they buy more wine and food .
It &apos;s a <unk> and dark bedroom , which is recognized by the paint of paint on the wall by the <unk> and the curtain .
This is often a <unk> abuse in the <unk> .
Stand in that corner , I remember feeling my <unk> , and that moment , I learned how to get inside of hell .
There &apos;s only one pathway : staircase that I come in .
There is no <unk> .
There was no big <unk> in the world .
These people have no escape , when we talk about the topic of difficulty , we need to remember that slavery , including the slaves of commercial sales , are also happening where we live .
Thousands of thousands of people are caught down in agriculture , in the restaurant , with <unk> , and the list is long .
Recently , The New York Times Times report that between 100,000 to 1,100 children , children are sold to <unk> sexual slaves every year .
It &apos;s around us . We &apos;re not just seeing it .
<unk> textiles is often thought about the <unk> .
I &apos;ve been to many villages in India where many families are <unk> in the silk trade .
This is the family &apos;s family .
<unk> black <unk> are the father , the blue hands and the red are his son .
They <unk> drugs in big boxes , and they <unk> silk into that liquid , <unk> hands , no poison <unk> .
My own version of the story tells you how they are .
They said , &quot; We don &apos;t have freedom .
But still hope that someday can leave this house and go somewhere else where we get paid <unk> . &quot;
I wish that there are more than 4,000 children that are doing slavery in the pond , the largest largest largest lake in the world .
And I was going to go , I went on a turn .
I see the scene like a fish fish on the boat , two boys , a few smaller , who seems to be right ?
Wrong . They &apos;re all <unk> .
Children were sent from their families , selling and <unk> , and they were caught out of the <unk> of these boats , no matter how to swim .
This is eight years old .
I was shaking down when our boat came , almost scare the boat through her little <unk> .
He was terrified because he was afraid of falling into the water
The branches that broke the <unk> <unk> often fell into the fishing nets , and the kids just <unk> fear are <unk> down the water to <unk> the tongue .
More girls died .
What he remembers , was he was caught .
The fear of the owner , I don &apos;t dare to flee , and because of being <unk> , I went to that down to the <unk> that I have .
I met these boys at five o &apos;clock in the morning , when they &apos;re pulling the last lines , but they &apos;ve worked for an hour .
It &apos;s dark .
It &apos;s important that these nets are too close to me .
I want to introduce you to you .
He was rescued by a <unk> village .
I met him in the aid that organized the National <unk> <unk> slavery .
Here you are bathed in wells , filled with the big and <unk> countries , and the great news is , when you and I sit on talking today , Kiva was reunited with families , and even more , the family was released to earn a lot of money .
<unk> is the embodiment of the ability .
How would you be somebody ever got up and changed their life ?
If you drive the car in Ghana , the same colleagues in the <unk> <unk> , one friend of the <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the car and then knocked it into the window .
He told us to walk in the <unk> path in the forest .
At the end of the road , he would say we were going to put us off the car , and drove the car .
And then just this blurry pointing here and says , &quot; This is the aisle , here &apos;s the aisle . Go . &quot;
And to go into that way , we put off the <unk> , and after about a hour of walk in the woods , traces had sunk in the water after the rains , so I was shooting by the <unk> , and I was using the camera that was
So after two hours of <unk> , the trace of a sudden <unk> in the empty space , and in front of us it &apos;s a huge area of holes , and the impact is all about <unk> , they &apos;re full of slaves .
Many women have children on their back while they &apos;re gold , and they &apos;re passing through the water of <unk> .
The bank was used in the process of extract out .
These miners were caught down in the basement in a different area of Ghana .
When they get out of the basement , they get wet by their own sweat .
I remember looking at the red eyes , their fatigue , because many people were underground to 72 hours .
The <unk> that went into the <unk> meters , they were taking their heavy <unk> bags to move them into the other area , which was crushed to treat gold .
Look , the <unk> field of rock seems to be filled with strong people , but when you look closer , there are more luck than working in extreme situations , having children .
They were both victims of suffering , disease and violence .
In fact , these muscle capabilities are ultimately like this person , getting <unk> and <unk> in a few years .
This is <unk> . When he died , he was sent to the <unk> .
As the uncle died , <unk> <unk> their debt , and was forced to <unk> the <unk> in this <unk> .
When I met , he worked 14 years in the mines , and the wound wound on the leg that you see from a accident in mine , a heavy <unk> that he had had to <unk> .
On top , <unk> gets T.B. , but still caught up day through the <unk> .
And yet , he still imagined that he was free to go to the help of local activists like <unk> <unk> , and determined like this , up on the face of strangers , which led me to fill up the <unk> .
I want to bring the slaves down .
So when I was working in this sector , I brought a lot of candles , with help &apos;s help , I was exposed to people who I photographed that I wanted to give the full stories and get their shoes , and then when they were safe , I was safe .
They know their shape will be seen by people out there , as you do .
I want them to know that we &apos;re going to be <unk> them , and we will do anything that can help them change their lives .
I really believe , if we look at people like the people , it &apos;s very hard to drill on such evil crimes as a slave .
The images are not about <unk> themselves ; they &apos;re about people , who are , like you and me , they all have value , honor and respect in the world .
There was no day I didn &apos;t think about the amazing people who were being <unk> by this . I had a great honor to meet them .
I hope that images will wake up a powerful source of people &apos;s energy , people like you , and that hope that power will shine on the fire , because there &apos;s no light , the monster of hell that will continue to live in the dark .
Thank you very much .
